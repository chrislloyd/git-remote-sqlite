# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) when working with code in [this repository](https://github.com/chrislloyd/git-remote-sqlite).

Refer to:

* @docs/development.md
* @docs/schema.md
* @docs/style.md

Some tips:

* Any time you make something consistent, please document the decision in @docs/style.md.
* Always write in a terse, to the point style.
* The tests are fast and easy to run (`zig build test`) - always run them after refactoring.
